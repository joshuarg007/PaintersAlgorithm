# PaintersAlgorithm
 This implementation of the Painter's algorithm in WebGL sorts objects based on their distance from the camera and renders them from back to front, ensuring that closer objects appear on top, effectively solving the hidden-surface removal problem by prioritizing the visibility of objects in the scene.
